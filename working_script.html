                I need to get some things off my chest.

*Enter left and take a seat at the table. *

It’s been a while since I’ve released anything of meaning on this channel, let it be music, a gameplay clip, a trailer or even a goddamn Twitch VOD. Hell- How about that 150 or 100 subscriber Q&A video that was supposed to be in production, which I can confirm hasn’t been started at all these years later, but I digress- I’m here now.

There’s quite a few things I need to address in this video for the people that actively give a fuck about me and the content that I make, as scarce as it is and I’m sure the even scarcer few of you that will, because I feel that you deserve a response. I’ll endeavour to not let topics bleed into one another, which ideally is how I’ll be writing this script, but knowing me I’ll let that break first chance my brain gets.
To give a brief overview of the topics I’ll be covering- I’ll be talking about my life over the past (on its way to being) two years, my thoughts on my continued foray with music production and the MLP music scene alike, why I’ve retired as a DJ, MLP Generation 5 itself, my mental health and what that’s like in today’s world (which I’m sure that some things within such will resonate with those of you that end up watching till that point) and potentially one or two more things that I can’t remember off the top of my head as I type this introduction up. 
I will warn, I’m going to go into depth with each topic. There’s your warning. With that, shall we jump in?

Topic 1 – My life over the past two years.

This journey begins with me making the big ass jump from my slice of life in regional New South Wales to South Australia. Having been living with my parents, I love you mum and dad, to now living with my wonderful partner who I literally adore, God knows when I’ll be filming this so I’ll kiss him off camera; Life got a whole lot different when I made it to this big country town, I’ll say that. I’d lost all my money in the move due to a miscalculation I’d made when packing up my belongings, which happens when you’ve never moved house like I have and end up with nearly 30 boxes of varying shapes and sizes and ask a shipping company to hike them a state over west for you, yet I had no-one to blame but myself. (Pays to do your research first.) This financial mishap was further realised when my job that I’d had a transfer lined up for took a whole ass month to complete and allow myself to start regaining lost income, which came in spats and was unreliable, especially when they’d stopped giving me shifts in general for an entire month. 

Not great, huh? 
After quitting and continuing the job hunt that I’d been forced to resort to, I’d managed to land my dream job working with and selling computers, laptops and the assorted goodies for both that comprise your gaming setup. The honey-moon phase was utterly fantastic, don’t get me wrong, but we’ll get to that later. 
Before I forget! We moved houses! Well- We moved from a unit to a house, which was pretty heckin’ baller, sue me for incorrect terminology.
Shortly after I was fortunate to be able to attend my very first convention! I would have rather it been a pony convention, but when you live in the middle of Bumfuck Nowhere-
*Flash Australia on screen with stylized text calling it Bumfuck Nowhere*
-unless you’re rich straight off the bat, have a job that pays well or simply don’t have bad RNG in finding sustainable income-

*point to me with an arrow and say, “This guy, but he also moved interstate too I guess, that shouldn’t be unreasonable when he’s broke as??” *
-then a furry convention will have to do. I’d had ambitions of playing at the convention itself, which didn’t work out as I really should know furries have no reason to celebrate and create music like we in the pony fandom do thus resulting in the existence of a musician sign-ups form being a thing that doesn’t exist, but I digress- I got to spend a weekend with not only my partner, but two close friends from Western Australia and another close friendo from Queensland itself. The weekend had come and gone rather quickly, thankful that I’d had people to spend time with, as the furry con wasn’t all that fun. (This one at least.) So, after that was said and done, parting ways with one of our friends, the rest of us took a road trip back down to my hometown to spend a few days, allowing me time for my parents and family to meet my partner and friends as well as catch up with an assorted range of friends and ex-coworkers alike. 
*Big breath*
Aaaaaand- Gather up the rest of my belongings I couldn’t take within my car and start the next big trip back to home in Adelaide. Word of advice? Don’t do that drive in two days like we did. Especially if you’re still on your learners’ license and are speed restricted. Aided with the fact my friends’ gearbox decided that destroying fifth gear on his drive from WA to QLD was a brilliant idea; It was pain and suffering. 
Bumper was also sick on the way back. 
*Show a scene of Bumper plushie with a mask on and an “Achoo!” *
I’d also even fell asleep behind the wheel briefly at one point on the second day!
*Skill issue plays + “Get enough rest” - text*
We got home safe though and promptly went to bed not too long after.
 
I can’t remember for how long they were here, but it was incredible having my friends stay over at our place and show them around Adelaide, even if it was only a fraction of what there is to see. Lowkey wish that was something that could happen more often-
*Mental health topic indicator*
We all missed COVID, except for one, who somehow acquired it and didn’t pass it on. 
Life went back to normal after that. I returned to work and became more familiar with the business as time went on. Slowly realising that if you worked at store-level, you were as expendable as anything. Working for this company was a nightmare, I’ll tell you that. It was effectively a dictatorship. If you had an idea that could help the business function better, you ought to be prepared to be met with utter silence and no consideration of any sort, not to mention that sometimes you’d even feel like they took it as a personal attack. I’ll also add a couple more points about this company that really grind my gears- They had blatantly lied about the employee discount that they’d offer once you’re off probation. It was a process that was an utter waste of time, a whole week of my life in fact, to receive a projected discount of 2.35% off what I wanted to buy in total. They had chalked it up to margins within the tech industry. However, this becomes unreasonable when you need to be off probation (a period of six months), deal with their backend that hasn’t had an update to the UI since the early 1990’s, put up with the disconnect from upper management and the stores and even add in the fact that the discount has to be approved by the head of the board of the directors, who is for lack of better words, the CEO as well.
Moving on however, they market themselves as a ‘retail store’ at the location I’d been working at yet took no steps to simplify this process for customers while retaining their click-and-collect focused business practices. (Confusing right?) 
To cap things off, if you’re not aware of Panopticon, it’s design of institutional building with an inbuilt system of control, originating from the English Philosopher and social theorist Jeremy Bentham. Thanks Wikipedia.
Don’t expect an in-depth recount of this in my next statement explain such. Google it if you want a better explanation. Or depending on who I get to proofread this document, they may just edit my statement. Who knows?
Essentially, it’s a prison that’s a circle in design all the way around, with a guard tower in the center. The doors of the prison cells are glass as well, allowing the prisoners to see out into the complex, sounding okay so far? The kicker, however, is the guard tower has one way glass, so the guards can see out, but the prisoners can’t see in. Effectively leaving the prisoners to be left in a state of “are they in there watching us or are we alone?”, with no visual indicator either, I will add. Same deal with the company I worked for. They can watch us through the cameras to make sure we’re working yet often there’s no work to be done between customers. The only place this matters is in the warehouse where stock is actively being picked and packed and loss prevention is a must with such expensive items.
 
Or if a customer attempts stealing something in the front-end. Not making sure if your workers are doing something out of utterly nothing, if you feel me?
Anyway, moving on- Sorry.
As time went on, we got ourselves a dog! His name is Gallus. For those of you watching, if you know, you know. For those that don’t- We named him after Gallus from the final two seasons of My Little Pony Gen 4. Cry about it.

A month later, we took a trip to Western Australia where I was able to do my first ever on-stage performance! I’d like to say I had a ton more fun at this convention than I did at the prior one, being able to spend time again with not only Bumper and the two friends from WA, but also meeting an incredible artist that I won’t name who we spent a fair amount of time with and the likewise as incredible artist Papiioca that I saw in passing since they were con staff. With that being said, we got to have brunch with all of us together the day we were leaving, so that worked out.
I will say, I had a ton of fun on-stage playing Dubstep like it was no one’s business, even if that kinda killed it in the eyes of I’m sure everyone that rocked up for my performance. I’ve also been meaning to upload the video of such but I’m waiting on an updated version of my logo that will incorporate my entire name into such for the title card. Oh well. Perhaps someday. We’re just nine months and counting on that.
After that con, I returned back to work at the dictatorship, now with reduced hours and a dire need for a second job. Which came two months later. 
I don’t ever recommend having two jobs, by the way. Balancing them is an utter nightmare. Especially when you need to be in touch with both employers constantly and deal with two entirely different work cultures. I’m sure the easy fix for that one is “Don’t be poor, lol.”
Fast forward past Christmas to the end of March, that dictatorship had finally taken its toll and I told them to fuck off. I was done with having no shifts for a month straight. (That sounds familiar.) The upside of that one is, I didn’t have to deal with them and I got to work at my other job which was absolutely fantastic in comparison and allowed me to regain some of my sanity. Which, as I type this script nearly three months later, I’m still there.
Obviously there’s heaps there that I didn’t cover, but you don’t need to hear absolutely everything. Just key things that I feel like I should cover as milestones.
It’s been a wild journey, that’s for sure.
